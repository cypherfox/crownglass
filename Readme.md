# Crownglass Web-UI

A library for adding a web-ui to golang backend applications.

Setting up the application is aided by a command line tool to create the initial cobra-style application.

## Standing on the shoulders of Giants

The `crownglass-cli` tool is based on the [cobra-cli](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli) project for creating golang command line tools using the [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) library. It borrows heavily on its code.
